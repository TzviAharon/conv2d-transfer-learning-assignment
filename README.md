# conv2d-transfer-learning-assignment
This repository contains the fifth assignment for the Deep Learning course, which involved two tasks:

Conv2D Layer Implementation: The first task was to implement a custom layer that mimics the operation of torch.Conv2D. This exercise was designed to deepen the understanding of convolutional operations in neural networks.

Transfer Learning with ResNet-18: The second task involved using transfer learning from the ResNet-18 network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This task focused on leveraging pre-trained models to improve classification performance on a new dataset.
